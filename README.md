# dotfiles


## LokEmacs
WIP and current working title.
Currently only has one dotfile and is focusing on elegant simplicity, while still powerful enough to do what needs to be done.
I am trying to aim for only one dotfile for simple installation on many different machines, will need to make exceptions for different Operating systems and other stuff. But as of now I am focusing on making it work on my own machine first. (Put on your own oxygen mask first and all that).

### The way forward
- [x] Make space the leader key
- [ ] Make ox-twbs work with org export
- [x] Make better keybinds for evil windows
- [ ] Comment more of my dotfile to make it understandable
- [ ] Create a WhatDoesMyPackagesDo.org file
