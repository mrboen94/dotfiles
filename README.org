* dotfiles

Note, you will need the Iosevka font for this version to work correctly. You can ofcourse change this yourself in the init file if you prefer another font.

** LokEmacs
WIP and current working title.
Currently only has one dotfile and is focusing on elegant simplicity, while still powerful enough to do what needs to be done.
I am trying to aim for only one dotfile for simple installation on many different machines, will need to make exceptions for different Operating systems and other stuff. But as of now I am focusing on making it work on my own machine first. (Put on your own oxygen mask first and all that).

*** The way forward
- [x] +Make space the leader key+
- [ ] Make ox-twbs work with org export
- [x] +Make better keybinds for evil windows+
- [ ] Comment more of my dotfile to make it understandable
- [x] +Create a WhatDoesMyPackagesDo.org file+
- [ ] Make the WhatDoesMyPackagesDo.org file more complete

*** Keywords in initfile
Here is a list of keywords to search for if you want to search through the init.el file to find specific things. To search type "/" and type the word. If more than one option shows up you can cycle through them by pressing "n" after escaping the search with RET (return/enter).
| Keyword          | What you'll find                                                                                                                           |
